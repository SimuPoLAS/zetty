Before the block is written => Methods are gathered

  => 31 Bit ValueCount
  
  => 1 Bit  1: Every number is positive/negative
            0: Mixed (positive + negative)
  => 1 Bit ONLY if the block has the same sign => signs for every number are defined at the beginning
            1: Every number is positive
            2: Every number is negative
  => 4 Bit the count of Bits of the biggest exponent is written (can have the maximum size of 2⁴ = 16 = int16)
  => 6 Bit the count of Bits for the biggest value is written (can have the maximum size of 2⁶ = 64 = int64)

Block Header is being written
  => 1 Bit -> if the follwing sequence of bits is a block (1) or not (0)
     1:  => 1 Bit -> has exponent or not
                  1: => 1 Bit -> is the exponent negativ 1 yes, 0 no
                     => the max amount of bits needed (in metatdat) for exponents -> exponent is written 
                  0: => no exponent, nothing is written
        => 1 Bit -> is there a pattern or not? 
                  1: 2 Bit -> Pattern (enum) is written 
                  0: no pattern, nothing is written
        => 8 Bits -> lenght of the blocks is wirtten 
        => 1 Bit -> should the amount of needed bits for the biggest value be overridden
                  1: the max amount of bits needed to represent the max amount of bits needed to represent the max value (from metatdata) -> new max amount of bits of the max value is written (although in the program just the max amount of bits of the max value from the metadata is written)

      Block is written
      if all numbers have the same sign the next bit is skipped 
        => 1 Bit -> is the sign of all values in the block the same ?
                  1: yes, the sign (1: negative, 0: positive) is written
                  0: nothing is written
      now every value is checked, the following operations are executed for every value in the block 
        if every value in the block have different signs a bit is used otherwise no bit is used 
        => 1 Bit -> decides if positive (0) or negative (1)
        if the exponent of ten of the value is bigger then the general exponant of ten of the block then the additional               exponants have to be coded into the number
        => max amount of bits of the max value -> the differenc between both exponents is being multiplied as n in (10 to the power of n) with the number of the value
        otherwise just the number of value is written
        => max amount of bits of the max value -> number of values is wirtten
  
This operation is executed until the end of the blocks 
The next case happens if no block is following 
     => 1 Bit -> if the follwing sequence of bits is a block or not 
     0: if all values have different signs the sign is written in front of the values 
        => 1 Bit -> negative (1) or positive (0)?
        => the max amount of bits needed for the max value => write the number of value
        If an exponent exists, it will be serialized through the upcoming operationn
          => 1 Bit -> positive (0) or negative (1)
          => max amount of bits for maxValue -> Value is written
This algorithm is called for every set of numbers in brackets (in OpenFOAM files)
